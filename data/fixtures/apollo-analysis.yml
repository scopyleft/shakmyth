      <p>Shakespeare's treatment of the myth is representative of the main symbolic interpretations of Apollo (especially in contemporary emblem books and mythographers): Apollo as the Sun, as associated with healing yet sometimes bringing about disease, as the god of poetry and music, as the god of learning and prophecy, as the embodiment of divine justice, truth and reason.&nbsp; But the treatment of the myth in Shakespeare also qualifies as distinct from the majority of the occurrences in contemporary drama and poetry, with the notable exception of masques.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the perusing of contemporary literature reveals a massive presence of the myth (over 3000 occurrences in all for "Apollo" alone). But they are mainly references in passing, or poetical stereotypes, especially in poetry and madrigals: Apollo's peerless music, the comparison of the lover's mistress' hair, or the mistress' lover 's hair, to Apollo's golden hair. Also common are the dead metaphors or stereotyped images referring to Apollo's attributes, such as the laurel-tree, the lyra or lute, and (especially) prophetic powers and oracle.</p>
      <p>Shakespeare's drama does make use of such allusions and references, but they are not so isolated, scattered, and their function is often not mainly descriptive, even if the mentions of Apollo, Phoebus &ndash; or, more often, the sun &ndash; follow one of the patterns listed below, which correspond to the symbolic attributes of the god (<em>see</em> <em>Secondary Sources</em>).</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>APOLLO PYTHIAN</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the Shakespearian canon, <em>The</em> <em>Winter's Tale </em>is <em>&nbsp;</em>the play that contains the&nbsp; greatest number of allusions to Apollo Pythian, and the god is also integrated to the dramatic structure, since the consultation of the Delphic oracle is part and parcel of the plot. Yet, the&nbsp; treatment of the myth is in no way original: Shakespeare merely follows his main source, Robert Greene's <em>Pandosto</em>, <em>The Triumph of Time</em> (1588). It includes the consultation of the Delphic oracle, its pronouncement that Bellaria is chaste, Egistus, the friend of the King, blameless, and Pandosto, king of Bohemia and jealous of Egistus, treacherous.</p>
      
      <p>Still, Shakespeare's treatment of Apollo Pythian differs from his contemporaries' in that <em>The</em> <em>Winter's Tale</em> is the only play is which Apollo Pythian is granted such importance. As will be seen, Shakespeare appeals to the god of oracles in many plays, but on the symbolic level and through the imagery, not openly as in <em>The Winter's Tale</em>. In contrast, in contemporary drama, the statistical importance of Apollo Pythian is overwhelming. Numberless mentions of the god's temple and Delphic oracle jostle with the actual staging of ceremonies in the aforesaid temple, and consultations of the oracle similar to the one in <em>The Winter's Tale, </em>to the same purpose of having a <em>deus ex machina</em>, and an impartial judge of legendary truthfulness, disclose an information of greatest importance for the unravelling of the&nbsp; plot <em>(see Contemporary Occurrences).</em> The function of Pythian Apollo, as Robert Greene summarizes it in <em>Frier Bacon, and Frier Bongay </em>(1594), is to "discover doubts, / To plaine out questions". But these various mentions and consultations of Apollo's oracle do not usually probe into the more symbolic layers of meaning as in most of Shakespeare's plays.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>APOLLO AND POETRY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong> </strong>All the mythographers describe Apollo (or Titan, or the Sun) as young, fair-haired, and of peerless beauty. The hyperbolic comparison of the beloved to the sun is also a topos of Petrarchan imagery, and the Petrarchan trope of comparing the beloved's eyes or hair to the brightness and beauty of the sun appears mostly in Shakespeare's comedies: <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> (1.2.84-86, 2.6.9-10), <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (3.2.55-56), <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> (1.1.169-170),&nbsp; <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (1.3.54-56, 58-60, 62-63). Allusions also appear in <em>Richard III</em> (the Queen, 1.2.249-250), <em>Titus Andronicus </em>(Tamora, 1.1.5-9); the image of the lover as the sun is an extended metaphor pervading the <em>Sonnets</em>, especially Sonnets 7, 18, 33, and 148.&nbsp; The Petrarchan simile is particularly developed in a courting scene of <em>Love's Labour Lost</em> (4.3), and throughout <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Love's Labour's Lost, </em>4.3.24-27.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>King (reads)</em>. So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not</p>
      <p>To those fresh morning drops upon the rose</p>
      <p>As thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote</p>
      <p>The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, 2.1.44-45.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Romeo</em>. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?</p>
      <p>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Love's Labour Lost</em>, the <em>Sonnets</em>, and most importantly in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, this topos is part of the dialectics of light and night, fairness and darkness &ndash; major antithesis in both parts of the&nbsp; <em>Sonnets</em>, and part and parcel of the intricate reflexion on tragic time in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
      
      <p>This poetical commonplace is copiously illustrated in contemporary poetry and drama &ndash; including many commendatory verses. Portia's "sunny locks" (<em>Merchant of Venice</em> 1.1.169) are matched by Isabel's portrait of beautiful Isabella in Thomas Heywood's <em>A Challenge for Beautie</em> (2.1.444-446). The treatment of the image is original, light and music being brought together into a synesthesia:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Isabel</em>. I rather think she was Latona's brood,</p>
      <p>And that Apollo courted her bright haire,</p>
      <p>Else envying, that her tresses put downe his</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The comparison of the fair mistress (or lover) to the sun is meant to underline her (or his) beauty, but also her (or his) virtue, as underlined by John Donne in his <em>Epithalamions, or Marriage Songs</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here lyes a shee Sunne, and a hee Moone here,</p>
      <p>She gives the best light to his Spheare (...)</p>
      <p>More truth, more courage in these two do shine,</p>
      <p>Than all thy turtles have, and sparrows, Valentine.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The sun stands for virtue and especially for truthfulness, which is another topos of amorous rhetoric. It is so common, indeed, that Troilus, in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, lists it among with other examples of "similes, truth tired with iteration" (3.2.172-174):</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Troilus</em>. ... similes, truth tired with iteration &ndash;</p>
      <p>'As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,</p>
      <p>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>King Harry, in <em>Henry V</em>, compares his heart to the never-changing sun to court Katherine of France (5.2.162-165). On the other hand,&nbsp; in Shakespeare, this topos is often twisted into a sad or ironical denunciation of unfaithfulness. Thus, Hermia in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> laments the loss of her lover by saying "the sun was not so true unto the day/ As he to me" (3.2.50-51); while the mad Ophelia, deserted by Hamlet, resorts to the same image to remind him of his broken promise (4.5.61-65).</p>
      
      <p>Two features characterize Shakespeare's use of these poetical similes or commonplaces:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reversibility of solar imagery &ndash; as in <em>Hamlet</em> &ndash; and the integration of these images to the symbolic structure of the play: to the language of worth and wealth in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, the antithesis of vice and virtue in <em>Richard III,</em> the dialectics of time and timelessness in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, or the logic of reversal in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>.</p>
      
      <p>Also remarkable is the coherence in Shakespeare's use of the sun in the courtly rhetoric of love. In contrast with contemporary literature, Apollo or the Sun is nowhere hailed as the god of poetry or the patron of the Muses: the references are always to its symbolic attributes and functions, but they are implied and used on the symbolic level, not discussed, as for example in Barten Holiday's <em>Technogamia</em> (1618) :</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Geographus</em>. Nay, I do beleeve there is a great vertue in Musicke.</p>
      <p><em>Musica</em>. O Sir, 'tis yoiur onely medicine of the minde.</p>
      <p><em>Geographus</em>. Indeed I thinke so, and that's the reason, 'tis likely, why Apollo is, the god both of Musicke and Physicke.</p>
      <p>4.4.51-54.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nor does the sun imagery or mentions of Apollo reflect the controversy over the legitimacy of music and drama, as is the case in contemporary plays such as <em>Technogamia</em>, and in many treatises on poetry and the arts. This is all the more remarkable as the most important treatises reflecting this polemical issue mention Apollo, especially the Puritan attacks of Stephen Gosson, in <em>The School of Abuse (</em>1579), in <em>Playes Confuted in five Actions</em> (1582), in <em>The Ephemerides of Phialo </em>(1579) ("Apollo was a buggerer, and Schoolemaster of perjurie"), or of William Prynne, in <em>Histrio-Mastix </em>(1633). Conversely, Apollo is summoned to the defence of music and drama in such major essays and treatises as William Vaughan's <em>The Golden Grove </em>(1600), Thomas Heywood, <em>An Apology for Actors </em>(1612), or George Puttenham,<em> The Arte of English Poesie </em>(1589).</p>
      
      <p>Also surprising is the lack of references in Shakespeare to Apollo's music, a most common feature in contemporary literature. Furthermore, the only mention of Apollo's music appears in the particularly stilted, theoretical and stereotyped definition of love given by&nbsp; Biron in <em>Love's Labour Lost</em>:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Biron</em>. For valour, is not love a Hercules,</p>
      <p>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</p>
      <p>Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical</p>
      <p>As bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair.</p>
      <p>4.3.316-319.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;APOLLO AND HARMONY</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>1. Shakespeare's symbolic use of Apollo: the link with moralisations and masques </strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The treatment of Apollo Pythian, or of the myth of Daphne,&nbsp; underline the extent to which, despite the common basis provided by the classical sources, the components of the myth favoured in contemporary literature are not those used by Shakespeare.</p>
      <p>Contrariwise, the use of the myth on the symbolic level, and on the scale of the whole play, is very rare in contemporary literature. It is also usually linked to the subject matter of the play, as in Lyly's <em>Mydas</em>. But, in Shakespeare, the use of the symbolic value of Apollo as the god of harmony and healing is massive, coherent throughout, and&nbsp; favoured over all the other meanings or episodes of the myth. Shakespeare selected this particular aspect of the myth and its use in drama is a series of variations on the same theme, that is, solar images as images of harmony, in all the fields covered by the god's symbolism of order and measure: learning, health in the microcosm, macrocosm and body politic, wisdom divine and political &ndash; or, as John Day sums it up through the allegory of the beehive at the end of <em>The Parliament of Bees </em>(1641),</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Obron</em>. Apollo, and the Muses dance;</p>
      <p>Art has banish'd ignorance,</p>
      <p>And chas'd all flies of Rape and stealth</p>
      <p>From forth our winged Common-wealth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In that respect, Shakespeare's use of the myth is very similar to the moralizations of Apollo (or the Sun) as the embodiment of virtue, wisdom, harmony, health, order, truth, measure. This symbolicism is described by the mythographers and in the emblem books (see <em>Secondary Sources</em>). The emblem books mainly use Apollo (or the Sun) as a symbol of measure, reason, righteousness, truthfulness, inspiration, knowledge, harmony. They make a Christian interpretation of these values &ndash; Apollo is moralized and christianized as the Light of God. The symbols associated to this interpretation are mainly the sun, the laurel-tree, which stands for constancy, honour, durability ; and the cock. Thus, in Cesare Ripa's <em>Iconologie, </em>although none of the figures represents Apollo,&nbsp;&nbsp; many of the allegories representing virtue, truthfulness, inspiration, are endowed with one or other of Apollo's attributes (see <em>Secondary Sources</em>). Ripa's <em>Iconology</em> illustrates the syncretism of symbols associating Apollo with the allegorical representation of knowledge, piety, virtue and truth.</p>
      
      <p>The selfsame syncretism is usually found in the masques (and also pageants and masque elements in plays), whose basic structure is that of harmony challenged then restored, and where Apollo figures as the embodiment (or allegory) of harmony. No less than thirteen masques stage Apollo as a major allegory of order in different allegorical guises, among which Ben Jonson's <em>&nbsp;Fortunate Isles, and their Union </em>(1626), and George Chapman's <em>&nbsp;Masque of the Twelve Months</em>, where Apollo appears with Harmony; Thomas Middleton's <em>Magnificent Entertainment given to King James</em> (1604), with Apollo representing Concord; Thomas Carew's <em>Coelum Brittanicum</em> (1633), where Truth&nbsp; and Wisdom are both endowed with Apollo's symbolic atributes:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Truth in a Watchet Robe, a Sunne upon her forehead and bearing in her hande a Palme, Wisedome in a mantle wrought with eyes and hands, golden rayes about her head, and Apollo's Cithera in her hand.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>2. Apollo and healthiness, or, Python defeated</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>See "Python"</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the masques, as in the moralisations of the myth, Apollo is associated to health, and thus to natural abundance and fertility. In <em>The magnificent Entertainment Given to King James</em>, a song in praise of Apollo describes the Sun's benevolent powers of breeding and increase (also described by Abraham Fraunce in <em>The Third Part of the Countess of Pembroke's Yuychurch</em>, and by Richard Linche in <em>The Fountaine of Ancient Fiction</em>) :</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>No, no, his beames,</p>
      
      <p>Must equall devide,</p>
      <p>Their heate to Orbes beside,</p>
      <p>Like nourishing silver streames.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The beneficial influence of the Sun-god is reflected by his victory over the serpent Python (<em>see</em> <em>"Python"</em>). The sun symbolically curing distemper and vanquishing vice by his victory over the chtonian forces, embodied by Python, is reflected in Shakespeare by many images of the sun drawing out the ill humours from the earth, echoing <em>The Fountain of Ancient Fiction</em>, in which Linche describes the healing powers of the&nbsp; sun,</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>... with the moderate warmth and temperature thereof, they [pestilences and infections] are chased away, and healthie aires and naturall increases spring up and are re-suceed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This image of the sun "chasing" unhealthy "vapours", and restoring the furious sea to calm, appears in <em>The Comedy of Errors:</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Egeon</em>. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</p>
      <p>Dispersed those vapours that offended us,</p>
      <p>And by the benefit of his wish&egrave;d light</p>
      <p>The seas waxed calm (...)</p>
      
      <p>1.1.88-91.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Similar images occur (to different dramatic purposes, discussed below) in <em>1 Henry IV</em> (1.3.194-200), <em>Othello</em> (3.4.29-31), <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> (2.2.5-6), <em>The</em> <em>Tempest</em> (2.1.1-3), and <em>Timon of Athens</em> (4.3.1-2):</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Timon</em>. O bless&egrave;d breeding sun, draw from the earth</p>
      <p>Rotten humidity (...)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>That the sun's "liberal eye" (<em>Henry V</em>, 4.0.44) be associated with harmony is illustrated with particular originality in <em>The Taming of the Shrew, </em>where solar images convey the restoration of the hierarchy of the sexes, threatened by Katharina's contrary disposition. The image of the all-powerful sun is indeed associated to Petruchio, as a metaphor of the nearly impossible task assigned to him:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Hortensio</em>. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.</p>
      
      <p>4.3.194.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When Petruchio eventually prevails over Katherina's strong-willed character, the "taming" of the shrew is expressed through images of confusion which, paradoxically, show that Katherina has to bend to Peruchio's will even to absurdity: she agrees to call the moon the sun, and the sun the moon. The final image is, symbolically, that of Katherina's <em>vision </em>of the world restored to clearsightedness, that is, absolute obedience to her husband:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Katherine</em>. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes</p>
      <p>That have been so bedazzled with the sun</p>
      <p>That everything I look on seemeth green.</p>
      <p>Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.</p>
      
      <p>Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.</p>
      <p>4.5.46-50.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yet, however interesting, the restoration of order in the sphere of matrimony in <em>The Taming of the Shrew </em>is only a marginal illustration of the association of the god with harmony in Shakespeare. Indeed, the&nbsp; main symbolic function of the sun&nbsp; exerts itself in the sphere of politics,&nbsp; as reflected by the seminal image of the Sun-king.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>3. The Sun-King and kingly virtue</strong></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In <em>The Book of the Courtier</em>, Baldassare Castiglione writes:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Therefore even as in the firmament the sunne and moone and the other starres shew to the worlde (as it were) in a glase, a certaine likenesse of God: so upon the earth a much more like image of God are those good princes that love and worship him, and shew unto the people the cleare light of his justice, accompanied with a shadow of the heavenly reason and understanding.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Shakespeare seems to echo this statement in Cleopatra's encomium after Antony's death:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Cleopatra</em>. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck</p>
      <p>A sun and a moon, which kept their course and lighted</p>
      
      <p>The little O o'th'earth.</p>
      <p>5.2.78-80.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This likening of the prince to the heavenly spheres, particularly to the <em>primum mobile</em> and to the sun, is indeed commonplace in contemporary literature, especially in commendatory poems, masques, pageants and other courtly entertainments<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. In the masques, the Sun-King represents political harmony and good political management. Sir John Beaumont's <em>Theater of Apollo</em>, a masque praising Prince Charles, describes the king as "the greatest of Maiestie, our Soveraigne, glorious Emperour, of Parnassus, most happy King of the Muses, and incomparable Monarck of Light". The setting of the masque is the Parnassus, and the curtain draws back to reveal Apollo "seated in a high, and glorious Throne, crowned with laurells". Prince Charles is placed below Apollo, in a chariot drawn by Fame.&nbsp; Thomas Dekker's<em> London Tempe, </em>Thomas Middleton's<em> Magnificent Entertainment </em>and many others have Apollo praise the king in similar terms.</p>
      
      <p>The Sun-king is also a stock image of political wisdom, justice and shrewdness in contemporary drama (<em>see "Contemporary occurrences"</em>) and the trope is used extensively by Shakespeare, as in the Chorus' description of Henry V, "the royal captain of this ruined band" (4.0.29),</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Chorus</em>. A largess universal, like the sun,</p>
      <p>His liberal eye doth give to everyone.</p>
      <p>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all</p>
      <p>Behold.</p>
      <p><em>Henry V</em>, 4.0.43-47.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The symbolism of the Sun-king holds pride of place in Shakespeare's history plays<strong>.</strong> Indeed, it is a recurrent and structuring image in both tetralogies and in <em>King John</em>; it is also present to a lesser extent in<em> Henry VIII</em>.&nbsp; The sun is associated to virtue not only in the king, but in noble counsellors; it is also resorted to highlight heroic virtue. Mentions include the description of Edward II's valour in <em>Henry V</em> (2.4.57-59), of the fame reserved for the men dying at Agincourt (4.3.99-104) ; the honesty of old Gaunt in <em>Richard II</em> (2.1.12-13), of the late Henry V in <em>1 Henry VI</em> (1.1.9-14); the honour of Northumberland and his son in <em>2 Henry IV</em> (2.3.18-21); and the praise of King James in <em>Henry VIII</em> (5.4.50-52)<em>.</em></p>
      
      <p>Outside Shakespeare's history plays, the same metaphorical description of kingly virtue is also found in <em>Antony and Cleopatra </em>(4.16.9-12, 5.2.78-80), where Cleopatra uses it to describe Antony; and in the description of King Simonides in <em>Pericles</em> (Scene 7, 36-43).</p>
      <p><strong> </strong>The solar symbolism attached to the prince is also woven into the symbolic structure of <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Timon of Athens</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Coriolanus</em>, <em>Richard III</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Richard II</em> and the <em>Henry IV</em> plays, <em>Cymbeline</em>,&nbsp; and <em>The Winter's Tale</em>. All these plays bear witness to Shakespeare's particular &ndash; and original &ndash; reversal of the symbol of order and harmony into images of chaos.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong>C. HARMONY CHALLENGED: THE REVERSAL OF SOLAR IMAGERY</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>1. From Apollon to Apollyon</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The sun's association with harmony (music), health (physic), truth and clearsightedness (light) corresponds to the capacity of the ideal monarch to maintain harmony in his kingdom, which is commonly conveyed by the comparison of the king as the physician of the kingdom. In <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, this function is likened to the sun's benefical rays:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Ulysses.</em> And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</p>
      
      <p>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</p>
      <p>Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye</p>
      <p>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil</p>
      <p>And posts like the commandment of a king</p>
      <p>1.3.89-93.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>But in many of the above-mentioned plays, the image of the sun's "med'cinable eye" is reversed &ndash; as in <em>Richard II</em>, where King Richard, as shown by the interruption of the judiciary duel between Bolingbroke and Mowbray in I.3,&nbsp; is ironically unable to "let blood" in order to "purge" the kingdom of internal strife ("Let's purge this choler without letting blood", 1.1.153). As John of Gaunt points out, he who calls himself a physician is in fact a sick man:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Gaunt</em>. Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,</p>
      <p>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick.</p>
      <p>2.1.95-96.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Gaunt's reproofs rely on a reversal of the sun's healing powers, which stems from the ambivalence of the myth, underlined by the mythographers and emblem books (<em>see "Secondary Sources"</em>) and in contemporary literature. Ben Jonson alludes to this ambivalence in <em>The Masque of Augures</em>, where he presents Apollo as "Far-shooting Phoebus he/ That can both hurt and heale"; but it is best described by Stephen Batman&nbsp; (<em>The Golden Book of the leaden goddes</em>), Abraham Fraunce (<em>The Third Part of the Countess of Pembrokes Yuychurch</em>), or Richard Linche (<em>The fountaine of ancient fiction</em>):</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Others that say Apollo is called Dio dell'Inferno, and give those arrowes so appropriated unto him, doe meane, that from the over-vehement ardour and riscaldation of his beames, pestilences and infections are engendered and nourished on the earth: but yet say they, not so universally dispersed, or undoubtedly mortall, but with the moderate warmth and temperature thereof, they are chased away, and healthie aires and naturall increases spring up (...)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Images of the sun that "hurts" instead of healing, of Apollon reversting into Apollyon,&nbsp; are many in Shakespeare (see below, "From sunlight to darkest night:<em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello&nbsp; and King Lear")</em>, such as Hotspur's description of his foe as a sun-bred fever in <em>1 Henry IV</em>:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p><em>Hotspur</em>. Worse than the sun in March,</p>
      <p>This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come!</p>
      <p>4.1.112-113.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yet, as also stressed by Linche, the difference between Apollo the healer and Apollyon the destroyer is entirely a matter of degree. Accordingly, in Shakespeare, lack of measure &ndash; a vertue in itself associated to the god &ndash; leads to the inversion of the benevolent sun into solar images of excess.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ol start="3">
      <li><strong>Solar imagery and hubris</strong></li>
      
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>See also "Phaethon" and "Icarus".</em></p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>The burning rays of hubris bring also figure the hamartia of such heroes, their tragic flaw, which brings about their undoing. Thus, in <em>Coriolanus</em>, the constant association of Caius Martius with images of fire (of which the burning sun is one) conveys his excess of choler and the betrayal to which it leads (Coriolanus joining the enemy of Rome, the Volsces, and&nbsp; turning his murderous wrath against his own people after they banished him). In this light, Brutus' spiteful portrayal of Coriolanus as "Phoebus" during his triumph after his defeating of the Volsces illustrates &ndash; with dramatic irony in every word &ndash; the threat that the fire in <em>Coriolanus</em> poses to his own country.&nbsp; His&nbsp; is not the gentle warmth of the sun, but&nbsp; "burning kisses" kindling internal strife, "the war of white and damask", in the cheeks of the Roman ladies:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Brutus</em>. Our veiled dames</p>
      <p>Commit the war of white and damask in</p>
      <p>Their nicely guarded cheeks to th'wanton spoil</p>
      <p>Of Phoebus' burning kisses.</p>
      <p>2.1.212-215.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The image of fire, two-edged (heroic vertue and image of destruction) and thus a constant source of dramatic irony, is&nbsp; intricately linked with the theme of blood, which espouses the structure of the play. For it is concerned with blood shed by the hero in battle and contributing to his meteoric ascent, but also with the spilling of the hero's own blood in his tragic death, a downfall triggered by his unyielding character and&nbsp; towering pride.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The hubris of those characters which reverse the sun's "breeding" warmth into images of destructive heat is also exemplified by Richard III,&nbsp; described as "the searing sun" in <em>3 Henry VI </em>(5.6), and associated in <em>Richard III </em>with the destruction of light, replaced by the shadow of evil and the shade of death.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Richard Gloucester</em>. (...) but I was born so high.</p>
      <p>Our eyrie buildeth in the cedar's top,</p>
      <p>And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.</p>
      
      <p><em>Queen Margaret</em>. And turns the sun to shade.</p>
      <p>Witness my son, now in the shade of death,</p>
      <p>Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath</p>
      <p>Hath in eternal darkness folded up.</p>
      <p>1.3.261-267</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The cluster of meanings in this cue sums up many of the symbols of reversed solar images: Gloucester's hubris in "scorning the sun"; his evil nature and political eagerness, as well as the many murders he committed, turning "the sun to shade"; and the extended metaphor of the "shade of death", an image also found in the many ilmages involving a cloudy or absent sun, and associated to dying characters.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>4. Obscuring the sun: omens of downfall and death</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong> </strong>Typically, the metaphor of the sun obscured by clouds signals a threat to royal authority. The trope is recurrent in the history plays, where it underlines the De Casibus pattern: in <em>3 Henry VI</em>, Edward's sun is described as "clouded" (2.3.7); in <em>Richard II</em>, Bolingbroke's "envious clouds" (3.3.65) are paralleled by his usurpation of the sun imagery, matching his usurpation of the throne, in <em>Richard II</em>. This image establishes one of the main thematic connections between&nbsp; the plays of the second tetralogy, for in the <em>Henry IV</em> plays and in <em>Henry V </em>&nbsp;it&nbsp; underlines the opposition between Richard II and Henry V. The imagery of the sun-king is skillfully used to show that Richard is a king in appearance rather than in reality, while Prince Hal is really a kingly figure whose appearance is deceptive at first. Richard's emblem is the sun of royalty emerging from a cloud, a piece of symbolism to which Bolingbroke refers when Richard appears on the walls of Flint Castle :</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Bolingbroke</em>. See, see, King Richard doth himself appear</p>
      <p>As doth the blushing discontented sun</p>
      <p>From out the fiery portal of the east,</p>
      <p>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent</p>
      <p>To dim his glory and to stain the track</p>
      <p>Of his bright passage to the occident.</p>
      <p>3.3.62-67.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Richard doesn&rsquo;t live up to this emblem: he allows the &ldquo;clouds&rdquo;, his evil advisers and enemies, to obscure his glory. On the contrary, prince Hal adopts the emblem &ndash; in the wake of his father, Bolingbroke the usurper (to whom the sun-king analogy is also applied in <em>1 Henry IV</em>)&ndash; but he justifies it even from his unruly youth, when he wants to break &ldquo;through the foul and ugly mists&rdquo;:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Prince Harry</em>. Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</p>
      
      <p>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</p>
      <p>To smother up his beauty from the world,</p>
      <p>That, when he please again to be himself,</p>
      <p>Being wanted he may be more wonder&rsquo;d at</p>
      <p>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</p>
      <p>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.</p>
      <p><em>1 Henry IV</em>, 1.3.194-200.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Later, in <em>Henry V</em>, the qualities of Henry V as a king and soldier are described with the same metaphor &ndash; the sun-king, this time unclouded and in the full glory of his &ldquo;liberal eye&rdquo;(4.0.44).</p>
      <p>More generally, in the tragedies, the metaphor of the darkened or cloudy sun applies to incompetent, enfeebled, overproud or reckless kings and characters of noble stature, thus underlining their political shorcomings and lack of princely virtues. Flawed or doomed characters and their impending tragic fate are also signalled by omens: the weeping sun in <em>Richard II</em> (2.4.21-22), the three suns (2.1.25-32) or the sun dimmed by clouds (2.3.7, 2.6.8-17) in <em>3 Henry VI</em>, the weak and weary sun in <em>King John</em> (5.3.33-36), or the absent sun at the end of <em>Richard III</em> (5.6.7-17).</p>
      
      <p>The image of the sun veiled by clouds, or of the setting sun (a variation), spans a range of meanings, wherewhith the light of life, soul or reason is dulled, obscured, or altogether extinguished. It expresses unfaithfulness or fickleness in the poet's beloved &ndash; and grief in the poet&nbsp; -&nbsp; in Sonnet<em> </em>33;&nbsp; it means impending death in <em>Henry VIII</em>, where Buckingham's darkened "clear sun" replaces the living daylight, leaving only the deadly world of shadows in its stead:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Buckingham</em>. My life is spanned already.</p>
      
      <p>I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,</p>
      <p>Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on</p>
      <p>By dark'ning my clear sun.</p>
      <p>1.1.224-227.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong> </strong>Similarly, the image conveys Titus' extreme grief&nbsp; in <em>Titus Andronicus</em>, his sighs "stain(ing) the sun with fog" (3.1.211). In <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, Achilles refers to Hector's last battle in terms of a setting sun (5.9.5-8), while in <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, Cleopatra, seeing Antony deadly wounded, exclaims:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Cleopatra</em>. O sun,</p>
      <p>Burn the great sphere thou move'st in; darkling stand</p>
      <p>The varying shore o'th'world!</p>
      <p><em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, 4.16.9-11.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And Timon, described as a "setting sun" right from the beginning of the tragedy (1.2.141), and compared to the sun throughout, bitterly remarks at the end&nbsp; (much like the Prince at the end of<em> Romeo and Juliet</em>, 5.3.304-305):</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Timon</em>. Sun, hide thy beams. Timon hath done his reign.</p>
      <p><em>Timon of Athens</em>, 5.2.108.</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5. Golden or gilded? Apollo's gold in </strong><em><strong>Henry V, The Merchant of Venice,</strong></em><strong> and </strong><strong><em>Timon of Athens</em></strong></p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Solar imagery is also twisted in order to debunk false virtue or undue boasting of valour, particularly through the symbolic link between Apollo and gold. This association between Apollo and gold is based on alchemical theory as well as on the theory of the correspondences. In alchemical theory, gold was considered of celestial origin and capable of transmitting "wonderful qualities", especially healing qualities (Agrippa) to other physical bodies<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>. In Elizabethan epistemology, the leading animals, metals, plants, trees, parts of the body etc. in the sets of correspondences linking the various planes of creation all mirrorred each other, as E. M. W. Tillyard stresses:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>"<em>le roi soleil</em> is only part of a larger sequence of leadership, which included: God among the angels or all the works of creation, the sun among the stars, fire among the elements (...) then oak, the rose (...) gold and the diamond." <a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The correspondence between Apollo and alchemical gold is also highlighted by mythographers (Christine de Pisan) and alchemists (Michael Maiers) (<em>See "Secondary Sources"</em>). King Philip in <em>King John</em> refers to the sun as an alchemist when he mentions the orb "turning with splendour of his precious eye/ The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold" (3.1.5-6).</p>
      <p>This ideological background is the key to the debunking of false virtues through the contrast between "golden virtue" and "gilded worth". The satire of the French in <em>Henry V</em> uses this opposition: the vain and superficial French are derided through their association to "gilded worth" (as Orleans remarks in 4.1.168-271,&nbsp; "The sun doth gild our armour"), not to golden virtue .</p>
      
      <p>In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, the correspondence between the sun and gold is part of the symbolic backdrop to the question of "love's worth", itself part of the play's reflection on the dialectics of love and money and, on the metaphorical level,&nbsp; on the deceptiveness of outward show. Bassanio's pursuit of Portia is likened to Jason's quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece, the comparison of Portia's golden hair elaborating on the Petrarchan topos:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Bassanio</em>. Her sunny locks</p>
      <p>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece</p>
      <p>1.1.169-170.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The wooring of fair Portia is entwined throughout the play with the issue of money. On the structural level, gold imagery is paramount in the main plot of Shylock's dramatic money-lending to Antonio, while it is central in the secondary plot dealing with Jessica's elopement (the strand of the plot where Shylock loses his "treasure"&nbsp; -&nbsp; his daughter and his ducats). The third strand of the plot, the wooing of Portia in Belmont, is also pervaded by images of worth and treasures relating to the "treasured" woman, such as the Golden Fleece or the choice of the caskets. But the gold imagery also relates to the theme of appearances versus reality. The misleading gold and silver caskets, the device of the golden rings at the end of the play, signify deceptiveness or betrayal. This is matched by Morocco's self-flattering portrait, the bombast of which aims at deriding his self-sufficiency, with further reference to the symbolic correspondence between the sun and gold:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Morocco</em>. Mislike me not for my complexion,</p>
      <p>The shadowed livery of the burnished sun,</p>
      <p>To whom I am a neighbour and near bread.</p>
      <p>Bring me the fairest creature northward born,</p>
      <p>Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,</p>
      <p>And let us make incision for your love</p>
      <p>To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.</p>
      <p>2.1.1-7.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In <em>Timon of Athens</em>, the issues of love and money are also entwined, although within the scope of political reflexion. The symbolism of the alchemical gold is not just twisted as in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, but altogether reversed with a view to underlining the reversal of Timon's personal fortunes and his growing misanthropy. Timon's sun, indeed, only shines as long as his treasure is full. The association is stressed (with not a little irony) from 3.4, where Timon is metaphorically described as the (too) prodigal sun-god, and the sun as gold. The servants emphasize the gap between Timon's limited wealth and the sun's infinite resources, thus hinting that Timon's boundless generosity partakes of hubris, and will turn out to be his <em>harmatia</em>:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Philotus' servant.</em> Is not my lord seen yet?</p>
      <p><em>Lucius' servant</em>. Not yet.</p>
      
      <p><em>Philotus' servant</em>. I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.</p>
      <p><em>Lucius' servant</em>. Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him.</p>
      <p>You must consider that a prodigal course</p>
      <p>Is like the sun's,</p>
      <p>But not, like his, recoverable. I fear</p>
      <p>'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse (...)</p>
      <p>3.4.10-17.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>The same image recurs in 4.3 together with that of fickle Fortune &ndash; epitomized by the reference to the moon, an emblem of inconsistency (<em>see "Diana"</em>). As in III.4 (and in 4.3.437-440, with the image of the sun's "thievery"), the mercantile vocabulary is combined with the metaphor of the golden sun to describe both the critical state of Timon's finances and his bitter realisation of the tragic "change" it triggered:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Alcibiades</em>. How came the noble Timon to this change?</p>
      <p><em>Timon</em>. As the moon does, by wanting light to give.</p>
      <p>But then renew I could not like the moon;</p>
      <p>There were no suns to borrow of.</p>
      
      <p>4.3.66-69.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Left without a sun to "borrow from", Timon is now a "setting sun". This shift from sunlight to darkest night, here underlined by the images of gold (itself encompassing the many references to money), also entertains a wide gamut of images of social, political as well as personal collapse in <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6. From sunlight to darkest night: </strong><em><strong>Hamlet</strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong><em>Othello&nbsp; and King Lear </em></strong><strong>and the reversal of solar imagery.</strong><strong></strong></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The aforementioned reversal of solar symbolism converges in the great tragedies with particular focus to convey the idea of disorder. The reversal of solar imagery relies mainly on the ambivalence of the sun-god (Apollo/Apollyon), which is channelled to different dramatic purposes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The references to the sun in <em>Hamlet</em> are mainly entrusted to Hamlet, and, in his mouth, they are part of his rhetorical apparatus in play-acting the madman. The allusions to the sun are always double-edged and offensive in the guise of harmless foolery; and they always refer to the idea of disorder on a variety of planes. Thus Hamlet's mention&nbsp; of the sun&nbsp; (with reference to the sun-king) when he transforms Claudius' dead&nbsp; metaphor, meant to inquire about his health,&nbsp; into a metaphor alive with dangerous irony:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>King Claudius</em>. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
      <p><em>Hamlet</em>. Not so, my lord, I am too much i'th'sun.</p>
      <p>1.2.66-67.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Similarly, Hamlet's inner turmoil is reflected in the bawdy undertones of the solar metaphor in his mock advice to Polonius in 2.2. Through Hamlet's bawdiness, in itself proleptic of Ophelia's fate (her only lover henceforth will be death), the metaphor of the healing sun&nbsp; is reversed into images of festering flesh and unnatural breeding which belong to the isotopy of disease pervading the tragedy.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Hamlet</em>. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion &ndash; have you a daughter?</p>
      
      <p><em>Polonius</em>. I have, my lord.</p>
      <p><em>Hamlet</em>. Let her not walk i'th'sun.</p>
      <p>2.2.183-186.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In <em>Othello, </em>the reversal of solar symbolism connects directly with the dialectics of fairness and blackness, light and shadow. Apart from the conventional comparison of Othello's grief to an eclipse (after murdering Desdemona) in V.2.107-110, the main image is in 3.4, where it draws upon the moralization of Apollo the Healer (<em>See "Python"</em>). With tremendous dramatic irony, Desdemona assures Emilia that a jealous thought never crossed her husband's mind. The irony stems from the association of Othello with the dazzling sun of his native country. The indirect reference is to Python, the embodiment of "ill humours", defeated by Apollo:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Emilia</em>. Is he not jealous?</p>
      
      <p><em>Desdemona</em>. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</p>
      <p>Drew all such humours from him.</p>
      <p>3.4.29-31.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The solar symbolism is reversed since, as underlined by Iago's remark in 2.3, Othello does not epitomize clearsightedness and reason, the enemies of blind jealousy. Iago uses the metaphor of the sun with reference to Apollo the Destroyer, the blazing sun whose malevolent heat causes disease &ndash;&nbsp; the untimely "ripeness" or growth Iago mentions being none other than that of the&nbsp; ill "humour" of jealousy (to use Desdemona's phrase):</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Iago</em>. Though other things grow fair against the sun,</p>
      
      <p>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</p>
      <p>2.3.366-367.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just as in <em>Hamlet</em> (where it expresses madness) and <em>Othello </em>(where is mirrors<em> </em>jealousy<em>)</em>, in <em>King Lear, </em>reversed<em> </em>or<em> </em>perverted<em> </em>solar imagery shows that&nbsp; the light of reason and truth is being extinguished in the main protagonists, with its train of political and personal consequences. Solar imagery is perverted early in the play; first when Lear, after displaying obvious proof of his injustice and obstinacy, swears by Apollo&nbsp; (1.1.151-152), then in 2.2, when Kent uses the image of the Sun-king in a conventional praise of the monarch:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Kent</em>. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,</p>
      <p>Under th'allowance of your great aspect,</p>
      <p>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire</p>
      <p>On flick'ring Phoebus' front &ndash;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(...)</p>
      <p><em>Kent</em>. (...) Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,</p>
      <p>That by thy comfortable beams I may</p>
      
      <p>Peruse this letter.</p>
      <p>2.2.103-106;154-156.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For all it is sincere in honest Kent's mouth, the bombast of his address to the king, relying on the comparison of Lear to Phoebus, has the reverse effect of&nbsp; stressing how much Lear is devoid of the solar qualities Kent endows him with. The simile, indeed, appears superficial and far-fetched in the light of&nbsp; Lear's blindness.</p>
      <p>Blindness, indeed,&nbsp; is the key-word to approach the reversal of solar imagery in <em>King Lear. </em>As early as 1.1., Lear's mingling of the Sun's "sacred radiance" and the Night's powers for evil when he rejects Cordelia&nbsp; (<em>see "Hecate"</em>) show a confusion of light and shadow which reveals Lear's darkened powers of judgement:</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Lear</em>. Thy truth then be thy dower;</p>
      <p>For by the sacred radiance of the sun,</p>
      <p>The mysteries of Hecate and the night</p>
      <p>(...)</p>
      <p>Here I discall all my paternal care.</p>
      <p>1.1.108-110; 113.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Similarly, in 2.4, Lear's early invocation to Apollo reverses into his vehement curse of the truly malevolent eldest sister, Goneril, a curse which&nbsp; hinges on the god's ambivalent powers for healing or spreading disease.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Lear</em>. Infect her beauty,</p>
      <p>You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the pow'rful sunday</p>
      <p>To fall and blister.</p>
      <p>2.4.339-341.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The ultimate reversal takes place in 4.5, where blind Gloucester meets mad Lear. With bleak irony, Gloucester resorts to the image of the sun to explain he cannot read Lear's letter.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Gloucester</em>. Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.</p>
      
      <p>4.5.136.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The metaphor can read as the final reversal of Kent's comparison of Lear to the Sun. Indeed, Gloucester's remark comes at a climax of the play and in a moment of maximum contrast (in a scene pervaded by images of infernal darkness, double-edged mentions of blindness and puns on "light") between Gloucester's eternal night and the solar imagery associated to light, truth and reason. For the blinding of Gloucester parallels Lear's madness, now a "ruined piece of nature" (4.5.129); the reversal of the sun image is thus a result and expression of his moral blindness and of the chaos it entails.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As emphasized by the particular coherence of solar imagery in <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Othello</em>, the reversal of the symbolism of the sun as used by Shakespeare serves the purpose of&nbsp; enhancing the reversal of order. In the History plays, the image of the sun-king is at the core of this reversal &ndash; a topsy-turvying of the world order and social hierarchies. As in the great tragedies, the ambivalent sun evolves into&nbsp; images of madness, blindness, jealousy&nbsp; &ndash; imbalance in the individual as well as in the State. In all the abovementionned plays, especially the tragedies, solar imagery also interrelates with&nbsp; a whole rage of images depending on the dramatic focus of the plays, such as the elementary symbolism and the image of the parasites in the garden in <em>Richard II</em>, the images of blood and choler in <em>Coriolanus</em>, the opposition of life and death in <em>Romeo and Juliet, </em>the imagery of disease<em> </em>in <em>Hamlet</em>, the imeges of blindness in <em>King Lear</em>,&nbsp; but also the dialectics of "love's worth" in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. All these images work in networks, so that tapping the Shakespearean interpretation of the myth really leads to digging deep into the symbolic structure of the plays. For superficial mentions of Apollo, Phoebus or the sun are rare, which also highlights Shakespeare's consistency in his use of the myth. Shakespeare actually resorts to a limited range of meanings of the myth, always the same, as is shown by the many echoes between the plays. Outstanding examples are the remarkable continuity in the treatment of the Sun-king imagery in both tetralogies, and the grounding of images of reversal on the ambivalence of Apollo and Apollyon, resulting in images of the sun breeding disease in <em>The Tempest</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Othello</em>.</p>
      
      <p>These close-knit networks of images are in turn intertwined with clusters of related imagery, and woven into the dramatic frame. For the&nbsp; main originality in Shakespeare's treatment of the myth is found in the plays where solar imagery is woven into the dramatic fabric: namely, <em>Timon of Athens</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> (albeit indirectly), the second tetralogy, and more marginally in <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Coriolanus, The Taming of the Shrew </em>and<em>&nbsp; The Winter's Tale.</em></p>
      
      <p>This use of solar imagery as a key metaphor of the play, evolving into close-woven clusters with all the other major networks of imagery, contrasts with the usually more descriptive or hackneyed use of the myth in contemporary literature (with the exception of Christopher Marlowe in <em>Tamburlaine</em> and <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, see "<em>Phaethon</em>"), not to mention contemporary poetry or music (with the exception of the masques, which often elaborate on Apollo as a symbol of harmony).</p>
