      <p><strong>Apollo</strong> is one of the twelve Olympian gods, born on Mount Cynthius, on the island of Delos, the son of Jupiter and Leto, and the twin brother of the goddess Diana. At birth, he was given a bow and arrows by Vulcan, while Jupiter presented him with a lyra strung with seven strings and a chariot drawn by swans. On Mount Parnassus, Apollo slew the serpent Python,&nbsp; after which the Pythian Games were named (<em>See "Python"</em>). Apollo then sought out old Pan, the satyr, and persuaded him to teach him the art of prophecy. He established the oracle at Delphi on the site of his victory over Python, and kept in his service the priestress called the Pythy.</p>
            
      <p>Apollo also defeated the Titans Tityos, Otos and Ephialtes; and he killed the satyr Marsyas, as a punishment for his musical pretensions (<em>See "Marsyas"</em>). As the god of Music, Apollo also sieges on Mount Parnassus, with the Muses (<em>See "Muses"</em>).</p>
      <p>Apollo loved many women. Some of them were mortal women, like Phthie, the mother of the Corybants; Coronis, whose son was Asclepios; Aria, the mother of Miletos, Cyrena, who gave the god a son, Aristeus. He also tried to seduce nymphs : Dryope, who gave him a son, Amphissos ; Marpessa, who remained faifthful to her husband Idas; Cassandra, whom the god instructed in the art of divination. When Cassandra rejected him after learning this art, Apollo revenged himself by&nbsp; telling her that her prophecies would be true but that noone would ever believe them. Apollo gave another young woman whom he had seduced, Sybill, the prophetic gift, and offered to grant her one of her wishes; scooping up a handful of sand, she asked to live for as many years as there were grains of sand in her hand. But she forgot to ask for eternal youth as well, and was doomed to remain an old woman until the end of her unnaturally long life.</p>
      <p>Apollo also endeavoured to seduce Daphne (<em>See "Daphne"</em>).</p>
      <p>Apollo was also the first god who fell in love with one of his own sex, young Hyacinthos (hence the jacinth, a flower born of his blood), who was killed by the West Wind, jealous of Apollo. Another young man beloved of the god, Cyparissos, became a cypress.</p>
      <p>Apollo is associated to the fate of his sons Phaeton (<em>See "Phaeton"</em>) and Asclepios. Asclepios was a renowned phycisian whose skill even restored a dead man to life : at which Pluto, the god of the dead, complained, and&nbsp; Jupiter killed Asclepios. Apollo retaliated by shooting the Cyclops dead with his arrows,&nbsp; but Jupiter flared up, in anger for the death of his armourers, and Apollo was punished by the king of Gods. For a whole year, he had to remain in the service of King Admetus, as a herdsman and helper.</p>
      
      <p>Apollo was also forced to work for King Laomedon, the king of Troy, in punishment for plotting against Jupiter (together with Neptun, Juno and Minerva). Apollo kept the king's herds while Neptun built the walls of Troy. When the king refused to pay them for their work, Apollo sent a plague to the Trojans.&nbsp; In the same way, he sent a plague to the Greeks during the siege of Troy, in defence of his priest Chriseos.</p>
      <p>The range of meanings associated to Apollo is wide. He is the patron of the fine arts, of physic, music, poetry, eloquence and prophecy, but is also associated with the tending of flocks and herds. In the Vth Century B.C., Apollo also became the sun god, with the epithet Phoebus (which means "bright, shining"). He then assumed the power and attributes of Helios, or Sol. Through his functions as musician, healer, herdsman, and his prophetic powers, measure and harmony are associated with Apollo. But the god's powers are double-edged: "the healer" (Euripides, <em>Alcestus</em>), he is also Apollyon, "the destroyer" (<em>Vatican Mythographer II</em>), "the archer Apollo" (<em>Iliad</em>), the vindictive god who flayed Marsyas, and a revengeful archer sending deadly shafts and disease&nbsp; to whomever incurred his wrath (as illustrated by the death of Niobe's children, or the plague sent to destroy the Greek army during the siege of Troy in the <em>Iliad</em>).</p>
      <p>The attributes of the "divine archer" (<em>Aeneid</em>) include the bow and arrow, and the lyra, symbolizing his skill as a musician and a restorer of harmony. The laurel is Apollo's tree &ndash; the Pythy munched laurel leaves during her prophetic trance &ndash; and some animals are specifically associated to the god : the dolphin, whose name recalls that of Delphi ; the wolf, the hind, the hawk, the vulture, the raven, the swan, and the gryffin.</p>
