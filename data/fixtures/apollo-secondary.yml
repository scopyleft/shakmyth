      <p>Apollo hath long yealow hayre : noting his rayes and beames, which beare and hit, like the dartes, a far off... He is young, fresh, and without any beard : for, his force never fadeth, and his heate is alwayes quickening.&nbsp; (p. 30). Phoebus... is not onely young and fresh, but he is also the authour of Physicke, the founder of musick, the gouvernour of the Muses, and father of Oracles, all which excellencies proceede from the operation of the Sunne. His beames be pestiferous if too hote, and therefore doth Homer make him plague the Grecian armie : but healthful if moderate and temperate. Of this moderate heate of the Sunne, comes the temperature of the ayre : of a temperate ayre grow holesome hearbes and flowres, the simples and ingredients of every physicall composition, and therefore Phoebus the author of physicke. (p. 33) (...) Now, he is also Musicall; and therefore Mercurie gave him a Lute; whereon he playeth; alluding to the harmonie of the coelestiall Globes, and the constancie and uniformitie, which the Sun observeth most strictly in his course, as ever keeping the Eclipticall line: for which cause he is the master of the nine Muses, ruling the concent and melody of the nine Spheares.(...) lastly, Phoebus is the father of oracles and prophecies, the eye of the world, seeing and hearing all things first, as Homer was wont to say, and Ovid in imitation of Homer,</p>

(...) he is Apollo, Sol, and Phebus, which three I doe make all one, him therefore the auncients (as I have already said) shaped with a very youthfull countenance, beardlesse, and young-yeard.&nbsp; (...) Many that have depictuted the shape of Apollo, make him holding in his hand a harpe with seven strings, agreeing in number with the planets of the heavens, which moving with a due destinction, yeeld forth a pleasing harmonie (...) The heavens (...) have every one their severall Muse, called by them oftentimes Syrens, as most harmoniously and sweetly singing, alluded unto the celestial orbes, which in number are likewise nine, and have their motions according as they receive their severall powers from the son, which commandeth absolutely both above him, here with us, and in the lower center: by reason whereof he is called <em>Dio del Cielo</em>, <em>della terra</em>, <em>e dell'Inferno</em> (...) The Harpe which (...) he holdeth in his hand, denotateth the celestiall and incomparable musicke of the heavenly orbes (...) and some also give him a quiver of arrows... which may signifie, that as they once losed from the bow, penetrate and enter in with great force where they hit, so the forcible vertues of the Sunnes transparent raies, search out and pierce through the smallest crase or voidance on the earth. Others that say Apollo is called Dio dell'Inferno, and give those arrowes so appropriated unto him, doe meane, that from the over-vehement ardour and riscaldation of his beames, pestilences and infections are engendered and nourished on the earth: but yet say they, not so universally dispersed, or undoubtedly mortall, but with the moderate warmth and temperature thereof, they are chased away, and healthie aires and naturall increases spring up and are re-suceed.</p>

      <p>In processe of time Jupiter having conceived a displeasure against Asculapius the sonne of Apollo for restoring a dead man to life by physicke; and concealing his dislike ...&nbsp; secretly incens't the Cyclops against him, who (Jupiter not prohibiting it) without delay slew him with a thunderbolt: In revenge of which act Apollo... shotte them to death with his arrowes.</p>
      <p>This Fable may be applyed to the projects of Kings, who having cruell, bloody, &amp; exacting Officers, do first punish and displace them, afterwards by the counsell of Trellus, that is of some base and ignoble person, and by the prevayling respect of profite they admit them into their places againe (...) But Princes (...) doe utterly forsake them, turning them over to the friends &amp; allyes of the wronged to their accusations and revenge, and to the generall hatred of the people, so that with great applause and prosperous wishes and exclamations towards the Prince, they are brought (...)
